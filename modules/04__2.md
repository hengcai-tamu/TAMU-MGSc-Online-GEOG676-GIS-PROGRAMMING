# Python Variables
One of the basic building blocks of a programming language are **variables**. Think of variables as a single named block of data. In Python, these variables are simply a name followed by an equal sign and then the value. You may have used and / or seen another programming language in which you put **var** or the data type in front of the variable name, but in Python that is not the case; only the variable name and value is required.
