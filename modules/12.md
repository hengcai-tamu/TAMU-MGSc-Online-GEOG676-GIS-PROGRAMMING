# Built-in Python functions
All programming languages have a set of built-in functions that make many tasks easier and simpler for the developer. Below we will go over several of the built-in functions in Python. Hopefully you as a developer can get some use from these functions and use them either in this class or in your career.
## abs()
This function is used to return the absolute value of a number. You can provide in either an integer or a floating point number.
>
```python
value = -8271.18
absolute_value = abs(value)
# Prints 8271.18
```
>
## bool()
This function is convert any Python value into a boolean value (True or False). This is a shorthand way of using conditionals to set a boolean variable.
>
```python
# Instead of this....
if x.hasData:
    result = True
else:
    result = False

# You can do...
result.bool(x.hasData)
```
>
## enumerate()
This function takes in a list and returns a list containing a tuple for every item in the list; each tuple then contains both an index in the original list as well as the value at said index in the list. Useful for when you not only need the value at a certain index inside a list, but also need the index as well.
>
```python
summerMonths = ["June", "July", "August", "September"]
for (index, value) in enumerate(summerMonths):
    print("Month ", value, " @ index: ", index)
# Prints
# Month  June  @ index:  0
# Month  July  @ index:  1
# Month  August  @ index:  2
# Month  September  @ index:  3
```
>
## eval()
This function can parse a string input and execute it as if it were Python code; effectively allowing you to run Python in Python. Many more uses that we won't be detailed in this class. Note that using eval() in conjunction with input() is a big no no for security reasons.
>
```python
i = 4
result = eval('i + 1')
print(result)
# Prints 5
```
>
## float()
This function takes in a string or a integer and returns a float representation of your input.
>
```python
four = '4.6' # You cannot do math to this value
float_val = float(four) 
print(float_val + 5)
# Prints 9.6
```
>
## hasattr()
This function takes two parameters: an object and an attribute name. This function will return a boolean value indicating if the named attribute is in the object you provide.
>
```python
class Vehicle():
    def __init__(self):
        self.color = 'Red'
myCar = Vehicle()
hasColor = hasattr(myCar, 'color')
hasMpg = hasattr(myCar, 'mpg')
print(hasColor) # Prints True
print(hasMpg) # Prints False
```
>
## getattr()
This function takes two parameters: an object and an attribute name. It will then return the value associated with the attribute name inside the object. This function is equivalent to using the dot notation (e.g. myCar.color).
>
```python
class Vehicle():
    def __init__(self):
        self.color = 'Red'
myCar = Vehicle()
# These two lines are equal
color1 = getattr(myCar, 'color')
print(color1) # Prints Red
color2 = myCar.color
print(color2) # Prints Red
```
>
## input()
This function allows you to prompt the user for some sort of input from the keyboard. The value of the input is always read as a string.
>
```python
userInput = input("What is your name? ")
print("The user's name is ", userInput)
# Prints whatever you input
```
>
## int()
This function takes in a floating point number or string and returns the integer representation of the input. If you provide a floating point number, it will remove the decimal numbers.
>
```python
x = .18467
y = 3.141592
print("x - ", int(x)) # Prints x - 0
print("y - ", int(y)) # Prints y - 3
```
>
## isinstance()
This function will tell you if the provided object instance is or descended from the provided class type.
>
```python
class Vehicle():
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class Truck(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self):
        pass

myCar = Vehicle()
myTruck = Truck()
print(isinstance(myCar, Vehicle)) # Prints True
print(isinstance(myTruck, Vehicle)) # Prints True
print(isinstance(myCar, Truck)) # Prints False
```
>
## issubclass()
This function will tell you if a class is a descendant of another particular class.
>
```python
class Vehicle():
    def __init__(self):
        pass

class Truck(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self):
        pass
        
print(issubclass(Truck, Vehicle))
# Prints True
```
>
## iter()
This function returns an iterator object, allowing you to iterate over things that support iteration such as lists or dictionaries. A useful example of **iter()** is to read lines in a file until a particular line is reached.
>
```python
# [Example](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functions.html#iter)
with open('mydata.txt') as fp:
    for line in iter(fp.readline, ''):
        process_line(line)
```
>
## len()
This function takes in a an object (string, list, tuple, range, dictionary, set) and returns the number of items in said object. This is useful for avoiding infinite loops and several other errors.
>
```python
x = [1,3,5,7,9]
y = (178,481)
z = "HELLO THERE"
print(len(x)) # Prints 5
print(len(y)) # Prints 2
print(len(z)) # Prints 11
```
>
## max()
This function will return the largest number in a list or will return the largest of two parameters.
>
```python
x = 6
y = 8
z = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(max(x,y)) # Prints 8
print(max(z)) # Prints 5
```
>
## min()
This function will return the smallest number in a list or will return the smallest of two parameters.
>
```python
x = 6
y = 8
z = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(min(x,y)) # Prints 6
print(min(z)) # Prints 1
```
>
## next()
This function is used to return the next item from an iterator.
>
```python
i = [1,3,4,5,6,7]
x = iter(i) # we turn our list i into an iterator

print(next(x)) # Prints 1
print(next(x)) # Prints 3
print(next(x)) # Prints 4
```
>
## open()
This function opens a file and returns a file object. The first parameter is the path to the file while the second parameter is the mode you wish to open the file in.
>
```python
file = open('textfile.txt', 'r')
```
>
## pow()
This function is used to return the result of raising one parameter to the power of the other. This is the same as using two asterisks (e.g. 2 ** 4 = 16).
>
```python
x = 2
y = 4
print(pow(x, y)) # Prints 16
```
>
## print()
This function prints text to the Python terminal screen for us to see.
>
```python
print("Hello world") # Prints Hello World
```
>
## range()
This is actually a data type we can use in several cases. When provided with a single parameter, the range will contain all the numbers from 0 to the parameter counting by 1. If we provide three parameters, we end up with a range that starts at our first parameter, ends at our second, and counts by our third.
>
```python
print(range(10)) # Prints range(0, 10)
print(list(range(10))) # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(list(range(1, 10, 2))) # Prints [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
for x in range(10):
    print(x) # Prints 0 through 9
```
>
## reversed()
This function returns an iterator in reverse.
>
```python
i = [1,3,4,5,6,7]
x = reversed(i) # we turn our list i into an iterator

print(next(x)) # Prints 7
print(next(x)) # Prints 6
print(next(x)) # Prints 5
```
>
## round()
This function returns a rounded number to *nth* precision.
>
```python
pi = 3.14159265359
print(round(pi, 4)) # Prints 3.1416
```
>
## setattr()
This function takes three parameters: an object, an attribute name, and a value. It will then add a new attribute to the object with the value provided.
>
```python
class Vehicle():
    def __init__(self):
        self.color = 'Red'
myCar = Vehicle()
# These two lines are equal
setattr(myCar, 'mpg', 19)
myCar.mpg = 19
print(myCar.mpg) # Prints 19
```
>
## slice()
This function is used to return a slice object. We can then use slice objects to return a *slice* of a list or a tuple.
>
```python
x = [2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]
sliceObject = slice(1, 4)
# These bottom two lines are equal
print(x[sliceObject]) # Prints [4, 8, 16]
print(x[1:4]) # Prints [4, 8, 16]
```
>
## sorted()
This function takes in two parameters: an input iterator (like a list or string) and a boolean indicating if you want to reverse the result.
>
```python
x = "GIS PROGRAMMING"
sort = sorted(x)
reversedSort = sorted(x, reverse=True)
print(sort) # Prints [' ', 'A', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'I', 'I', 'M', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'R', 'R', 'S']
print(reversedSort) # Prints ['S', 'R', 'R', 'P', 'O', 'N', 'M', 'M', 'I', 'I', 'G', 'G', 'G', 'A', ' ']
```
>
## str()
This function turns data types into string representations.
>
```python
x = 43
stringy = str(x)
print(type(x)) # Prints <class 'int'>
print(type(stringy)) # Prints <class 'str'>
```
>
## sum()
This function is used to return the sum of all parts of an iterable, such as a list.
>
```python
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
print(sum(x)) # Prints 36
```
>
## tuple()
This function is used to create a new variable with a type tuple. Tuples are similar to lists, but use parentheses instead of square brackets.
>
```python
t = ("a", "b", "c")
print(t) # Prints ('a', 'b', 'c')
```
>
## type()
This function is used to return the data type or class type a particular variable is.
>
```python
x = 43
stringy = str(x)
print(type(x)) # Prints <class 'int'>
print(type(stringy)) # Prints <class 'str'>
```
