# Variable reassignment
When you create a variable with a value in Python, you are free to change or **reassign** the value of that variable to whatever you wish. All it takes to **reassign** a value is to write the variable and use an equal sign to set the value equal to a new value.

```python
name = "Texas A.M.C."
print(name) # Prints Texas A.M.C. 
name = "Texas A&M University"
print(name) # Prints Texas A&M University

## Abbreviated assignment
One of the nice shortcuts one can use when programming are abbreviated assignments. If we have a variable **count** that we want to increment by 1, we would have to do something like this:
>
```python
count = 0
count = count + 1
```

It's not overly complicated but it isn't concise either. We can make this simpler by using an **abbreviated assignment**. 
>
```python
count = 0
count += 1          # Increase value of count by 1
```
>
All the abbreviation means is the value of **count** is now equal to the *current* value plus 1. We can apply the same logic to more than just addition. We can use subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. For those who don't know, modulus is an operator that we can use to get the remainder from the division of two numbers.

```python
count = 99
count -= 5 
# prints 94

count = 1
count *= 8
# prints 8

count = 81
count /= 9
# prints 9

count = 9
count %=4
#prints 1
```
