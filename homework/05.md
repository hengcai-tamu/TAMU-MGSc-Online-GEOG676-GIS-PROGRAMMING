>**Topic:** Creating a toolbox
>**100 pt**


# **Outcomes:**
1. Learn how to perform some advanced spatial analysis (e.g. Clip, Dissolve, Union) using python code.
2. Understand the tool making process and create a basic arcpy-based tool.
3. Learn how to create a ArcGIS toolbox with your tool.
4. Learn what cursors are and when and how you would use them.

# **Task:**
> 1. Turn the script created for HW04 into a tool
> 2. Add the tool into a toolbox

# **To Hand In:**
1. Link to your Github page that contains the Python code
2. Screenshot of the tool you developed displayed in ArcGIS Pro

# Creating a toolbox
For this homework assignment, you will need a working version of HW04. Now would be a good time to iron out any issues you had with it. You are tasked with taking the script from HW04 and turning it into a tool. Once the tool has been created you will need to add it to a toolbox.
# The tool
As a refresher, the objective of HW04 was to create a script that would determine which buildings on campus intersected with a buffer of the garage's centroid locations. For this homework assignment, you will need to take the portion of the script for buffering and intersecting and turn it into a tool. Do not worry about reading in the garage locations and building a geodatabase from that; you should already have that information from HW04. Once you have a tool created, add it into a toolbox.
