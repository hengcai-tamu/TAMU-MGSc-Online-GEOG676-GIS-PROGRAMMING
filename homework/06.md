# Map generation toolbox
For this homework assignment, you will need to create a toolbox whose job is to create either a GraduatedColorsRenderer or UniqueValueRenderer based map. Once you have a working toolbox, you will need to add in a progressor who's label tracks what portion of the code is executing. This means the progressor should increment every so often and the label text should change with each progression.
